/*
event life cycle:
The event flow model specified by DOM Level 2 Events has three phases to it:

1.Event Capturing Phase
2.At the target
Event Bubbling Phase.
First occurs Event Capturing, provided there exists an opportunity to intercept the event.

Then the actual target gets the event

Then it get to the final phase of bubbling, which allows a final response to the event.

Referring to the previous example, clicking the <div> element fires the event in the order as specified by the diagram above.
